### M E M O R A N D U M
 
**TO:** Department Directors

**FROM:** Marc A. Ott, City Manager

**DATE:** April 8, 2015

**SUBJECT:** City of Austin Open Data Initiative 2.0
 
##Summary
The City of Austin is committed to an open and transparent government. I believe this is an integral part of maintaining a vital and robust democracy. With the development of new technologies and an increasingly connected and engaged population, a growing expectation is being placed on government leaders to promote transparency, citizen participation, and collaboration.  This requires that each City Department strive to provide as much data as possible online, in accessible formats, to encourage public review, oversight, and participation. 
 
In the next 90 days, each City Department will be required to participate in the City of Austin Open Data Initiative 2.0. This will include requirements to identify department leaders in this area, make new data available to the public, and refresh data that has been previously published via the City of Austin Open Data Portal.

##Background
###Impact of Open Data
Open data can be used as a platform to improve City services, inform and improve decision-making, and invite partnerships with both government and private entities to find innovative solutions to problems challenging our community. Since the launch of the City of Austin Open Data Portal (data.austintexas.gov) in 2011, the City has seen the incredible value of open data. This has been demonstrated in our ongoing partnership with Code for America—an invaluable peer whose mission is to transform government through technological innovation, agility and community partnership.  Locally, the City has fostered a positive and productive relationship with Open Austin. This group of software developers and policy advocates sponsor civic hackathons, workshops and consult on open government activities.  We have also taken a leadership role in developing regional partnerships with Travis County, the State of Texas, Capital Metro and other government agencies to explore sharing our data, resources, and experiences. There is also a burgeoning interest from universities, businesses, startups and incubators to use City of Austin data for research and economic growth.

###Department Involvement
As the City’s Open Data Initiative matures and the benefits become more tangible, it is clear that the strategy for continued growth and opportunity in this space must evolve.  We must continue to grow not only in the amount of data we make available, but also improve the data’s quality, timeliness, and accuracy. To accomplish this, it is essential to transform our commitment to open data from an initiative to an integral part of the City’s culture.
I look to each of you to continue to build around the principle of transparent government and go further than we have previously to explore greater opportunities with open data.  I have charged the Open Government Executive Board, chaired by Assistant City Manager Rey Arellano, to lead this effort and the implementation of this plan.

## Schedule
In order to change how government works, provide more effective services, drive data informed decision-making, and promote economic development opportunities, all Departments and Offices within the City of Austin are required to take the following steps to participate in the City’s Open Data Initiative 2.0 that will begins with the issuance of this memorandum.

### Within 30 days

1. Identify an Open Data Liaison to represent and lead their department’s participation in the City’s Open Data Initiative.
2. Create an inventory of known data managed and maintained by the department. The inventory will indicate:
  
  a. If the information is publicly-accessible;
  
  b. The date of when the information was made publicly-accessible or when it is scheduled to be made public;
  
  c. The date the information was last updated or when it is scheduled to be updated;
  
  d. If the data is in a consumable format;
  
  e. If the information is from a primary source or has been aggregated or modified;  and
  
  f. If the information is restricted by any legal, license or privacy restrictions.

### Within 60 days

1. Department Directors and Open Data Liaisons will participate in workshops designed to inform, inspire and provide pathways towards participation in the City’s Open Data Initiative.

2. Data Liaisons will participate in public outreach efforts to learn about interest areas for Open Data.

3. Data Liaisons will be responsible for assessing department readiness and develop a plan/schedule to begin releasing data on the City Open Data Portal.

 
### Within 90 days
1. Each department will identify at least three data sets to publish on the City of Austin Data Portal.

2. Each Department and Office will publish their plan/schedule to release additional Open Data over the next 12 months. This plan will need to be actively maintained and updated by the department’s Open Data Liaison. The plan will be posted on the Open Government section of AustinTexas.gov.

3. A scorecard showing the level of department participation in publishing Open Data will be posted on the Open Government section of AustinTexas.gov.

 

### Ongoing

1. Report on plan status and progress on a quarterly basis.

2. Review performance measures and establish new measures annually.

Training will be provided with the help of the Open Government Executive Board and the Office of Innovation to accomplish this ambitious schedule.  The strategy is to implement a framework that is sustainable, meets the City’s open data goals, provides measures for success and incentivizes participation inside and outside the organization.  I welcome your enthusiastic response to this plan and will look forward to evaluating our success in this area on a regular basis.
