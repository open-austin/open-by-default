RECOMMENDATION

WHEREAS, public, educational and governmental (PEG) cable channels play a significant role in the City of Austin; and

WHEREAS, PEG channels provide critical services to local residents, including coverage of local government and school board meetings, local news and unique community information, youth programming, and distance learning educational opportunities; and

WHEREAS, PEG channels provide a means for citizens to stay informed about the actions taken by local elected officials, as well as provide a window through which residents can view the diversity of cultures, recreational activities and artistic endeavors in their local community; and

WHEREAS, Austin’s public access center is one of many community media centers nationwide that provide digital literacy training for our youth and adults and provide employment opportunities;  and

WHEREAS, Austin’s public access community media center produces more than 7,900 hours of original local programming each year; and

WHEREAS, an increasing number of states, including Texas, have enacted laws that establish state-level franchising agreements that lack federal protection and imperil local franchise agreements and the funding they provide for PEG channels; and

WHEREAS, the Federal Community Access Preservation Act (CAP Act) responds to several immediate threats to community media;   

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RECOMMENDED BY THE AUSTIN COMMUNITY TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION:

We recommend that the Communications Act of 1934 be amended by way of the CAP Act
so that funding for public, educational and governmental access channels may be used to support basic operational costs and ensures that their content is treated the same as other local broadcast channels; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RECOMMENDED:

1. 	The City of Austin supports immediate passage of the CAP Act.
2.	The Austin City Council calls upon our Congressional delegation to take all possible 	actions in support of the passage of the CAP Act, including endorsing, co-	sponsoring, and voting for the CAP Act and to work for its rapid passage.
